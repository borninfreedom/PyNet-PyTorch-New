#### 1. Overview [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.05509.pdf) [[TensorFlow Implementation]](https://github.com/aiff22/PyNET) [[Project Webpage]](http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~ihnatova/pynet.html)

![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+)&nbsp; *This is an alternative PyTorch implementation of the paper. The original codes and pre-trained models can be found [here](https://github.com/aiff22/PyNET).*

This repository provides PyTorch implementation of the RAW-to-RGB mapping approach and PyNET CNN presented in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/). The model is trained to convert **RAW Bayer data** obtained directly from mobile camera sensor into photos captured with a professional Canon 5D DSLR camera, thus replacing the entire hand-crafted ISP camera pipeline. The provided pre-trained PyNET model can be used to generate full-resolution **12MP photos** from RAW (DNG) image files captured using the Sony Exmor IMX380 camera sensor. More visual results of this approach for the Huawei P20 and BlackBerry KeyOne smartphones can be found [here](http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~ihnatova/pynet.html#demo).

#### 2. Prerequisites

- Python: scipy, numpy, imageio and pillow packages
- [PyTorch + TorchVision](https://pytorch.org/) libraries
- Nvidia GPU

<br/>

#### 3. First steps

- Download the pre-trained [PyNET model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PMP2ntbmV7fQaQeewbr_dw6-4zTR1PEM/view?usp=sharing) <sup>*(PSNR: 21.17, MS-SSIM: 0.8623)*</sup> and put it into `models/original/` folder.
- Download [Zurich RAW to RGB mapping dataset](http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~ihnatova/pynet.html#dataset) and extract it into `raw_images/` folder.    
  <sub>This folder should contain three subfolders: `train/`, `test/` and `full_resolution/`</sub>

#### 4. PyNET CNN

<br/>

PyNET architecture has an inverted pyramidal shape and is processing the images at **five different scales** (levels). The model is trained sequentially, starting from the lowest 5th layer, which allows to achieve good reconstruction results at smaller image resolutions. After the bottom layer is pre-trained, the same procedure is applied to the next level till the training is done on the original resolution. Since each higher level is getting **upscaled high-quality features** from the lower part of the model, it mainly learns to reconstruct the missing low-level details and refines the results. In this work, we are additionally using one upsampling convolutional layer (Level 0) on top of the model that upscales the image to its target size.

Compared to the original [TensorFlow model](https://github.com/aiff22/PyNET), this implementation contains three major modifications:

1. Instance normalization is used in PyNET's level 1.
2. Transposed convolutional layers are replaced with upsampling convolution.
3. Modified weight coefficients of the loss functions.

<br/>

#### 5. Training the model

The model is trained level by level, starting from the lowest (5th) one:

```bash
python train_model.py level=<level>
```

Obligatory parameters:

>```level```: **```5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0```**

Optional parameters and their default values:

>```batch_size```: **```50```** &nbsp; - &nbsp; batch size [small values can lead to unstable training] <br/>
>```learning_rate```: **```5e-5```** &nbsp; - &nbsp; learning rate <br/>
>```restore_epoch```: **```None```** &nbsp; - &nbsp; epoch to restore (when not specified, the last saved model for PyNET's ```level+1``` is loaded)<br/>
>```num_train_epochs```: **```8, 8, 17, 17, 25, 50 (for levels 5 - 0)```** &nbsp; - &nbsp; the number of training epochs <br/>
>```dataset_dir```: **```raw_images/```** &nbsp; - &nbsp; path to the folder with **Zurich RAW to RGB dataset** <br/>

</br>

Below we provide the commands used for training the model on **four** Nvidia Tesla V100 GPUs, each one with 16GB of RAM. When using GPUs with a smaller total amount of memory, the batch size should be adjusted accordingly:

```bash
python train_model.py level=5 batch_size=50 num_train_epochs=8
python train_model.py level=4 batch_size=50 num_train_epochs=8
python train_model.py level=3 batch_size=50 num_train_epochs=17
python train_model.py level=2 batch_size=50 num_train_epochs=17
python train_model.py level=1 batch_size=16 num_train_epochs=25
python train_model.py level=0 batch_size=12 num_train_epochs=50
```

<br/>

#### 6. Test the provided pre-trained models on full-resolution RAW image files

```bash
python test_model.py level=0 orig=true
```

Optional parameters:

>```use_gpu```: **```true```**,**```false```** &nbsp; - &nbsp; run the model on GPU or CPU <br/>
>```dataset_dir```: **```raw_images/```** &nbsp; - &nbsp; path to the folder with **Zurich RAW to RGB dataset** <br/>

<br/>

#### 7. Test the obtained model on full-resolution RAW image files

```bash
python test_model.py level=<level>
```

Obligatory parameters:

>```level```: **```5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0```**

Optional parameters:

>```restore_epoch```: **```None```** &nbsp; - &nbsp; epoch to restore (when not specified, the last saved model for level=```<level>``` is loaded)<br/>
>```use_gpu```: **```true```**,**```false```** &nbsp; - &nbsp; run the model on GPU or CPU <br/>
>```dataset_dir```: **```raw_images/```** &nbsp; - &nbsp; path to the folder with **Zurich RAW to RGB dataset** <br/>

<br/>

>```models/```            &nbsp; - &nbsp; logs and models that are saved during the training process <br/>
>```models/original/```   &nbsp; - &nbsp; the folder with the provided pre-trained PyNET model <br/>
>```raw_images/```        &nbsp; - &nbsp; the folder with Zurich RAW to RGB dataset <br/>
>```results/```           &nbsp; - &nbsp; visual image results saved while training <br/>
>```results/full-resolution/``` &nbsp; - &nbsp; visual results for full-resolution RAW image data saved during the testing <br/>
